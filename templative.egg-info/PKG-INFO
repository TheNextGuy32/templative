Description: # Templative
        
        Define the cards youâ€™d like created and how to assemble them, use the CLI, and purchase the game off of the Game Crafter.
        
        ## Install
        
        ### To Keep
        `pip install .`
        
        ### To Develop
        `python setup.py develop`
        
        ## QuickStart
        
        - Create an account on the [Game Crafter](https://www.thegamecrafter.com)
        - Get an [api key](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/account/apikeys) from the Game Crafter
        - Add the `THEGAMECRAFTER_PUBLIC_KEY`, `THEGAMECRAFTER_USERNAME`, and `THEGAMECRAFTER_PASSWORD` to your [env vars](https://www.schrodinger.com/kb/1842)
        - Clone and cd into `tyrus-pipeline-cli`
        - `pip install .` to add `tyruspipeline` to your path.
        - Create and cd into a directory for your game
        - `tyruspipeline init`
        - `tyruspipeline produce -u` to create a version of the game. Add `-u` to upload the game to the Game Crafter.
        
        Use `tyruspipeline --help` for more info.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Creating a New Component
        
        - Create a new component within `components.json`
        - Create a new csv doc within the `componentDataDirectory` defined in the `game-compose`
        - Define an svg template within the `artTemplatesDirectory` defined in the `game-compose`. See the [Artfile Guide](###-Artfile-Guide)
        - Define an art metadata doc within the `artdataDirectory` defined in the `game-compose`. See [Defining Art Metadata](###-Defining-Art-Metadata)
        
        ### Defining Gamedata
        
        Gamedata files are csv's that contain rows of piece data. All gamedata files must include the headers `name`, `displayName`, `quantity`.
        
        ### Artfile Guide
        
        - Art files must have a `viewbox` of `0 0 69.86129 95.265602`
        - Document sizes must be `69.861 mm x 95.266 mm`
        
        ### Defining Art Metadata
        
        Art metadata files are json files that contain instructions for how to assemble a piece jpg from art files.
        
        Data piped into art files using art metadata can come from many sources. Currently data from the `game json blob`, `component json blob`, and `piece csv row` can be used to populate a file.
        
            { "scope": "game", "source": "displayName", "key": "gameName" }
        
        This would replace all instance of {gameName} in the svg with the game's display name.
        
        #### Text Replacements
        
        Text replacements find instances of the {key} and replace it with the sourced value.
        
        #### Overlays
        
        Overlays are svgs that are overlaid on top of the template svg.
        
        #### Style Updates
        
        Style updates allow you to update a style attribute of a svg element at a given id.
