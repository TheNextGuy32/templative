# Tyrus Card Pipeline

Define the cards youâ€™d like created, use the CLI, and purchase the game off of the Game Crafter. Cards are assembled from svg templates.

## Install

### To Keep
`pip install .`

### To Develop
`python setup.py develop`

## Usage

- Create an account on the [Game Crafter](https://www.thegamecrafter.com)
- Get an [api key](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/account/apikeys) from the Game Crafter
- Add the `THEGAMECRAFTER_PUBLIC_KEY`, `THEGAMECRAFTER_USERNAME`, and `THEGAMECRAFTER_PASSWORD` to your env vars
- Clone and cd into `tyrus-pipeline-cli`
- `pip install .` to add `tyruspipeline` to your path.
- Clone and cd into `apcw-defines`
- `tyruspipeline produce -u` to create a version of the game and upload it. Remove `-u` to simple produce the game without uploading it.

Use `tyruspipeline --help` for more info.

## Todo

- Parallelize art creation and upload
- Allow replacing of a specific layer of svg
- Allow for back data defining at gamedata/artMetadata level to enable cards with similar gamedata but different backs to live in the same component
